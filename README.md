# Wara Wara Plaza Base64 Encoder
This is a quick Python Script to convert a Base64 string taken from the Wara Wara Plaza XML file to a tga file, or convert a tga file to xml
  
  # How do you use it?
  To run the script, run it in a terminal with the filename you wish to input as an argument. It will automatically detect what to convert it into (if you input a .tga file, it will convert into a .txt file, and vice versa), and it will output a file with the same name as the input.
  
 * Thanks to Ash for figuring out what the file type was like 2 years ago (https://gist.github.com/QuarkTheAwesome/143541120b7e1394c218976b0b330671)
  * Also thanks to my buddy wallefan for writing a better script than me lmao
